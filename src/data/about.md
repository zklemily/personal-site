# Intro
I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer and Information Technology and Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Economic Analysis.


I have a passion for solving problems, helping others, and enjoying the great outdoors. My journey has taken me across different continents and cities, each shaping my unique perspective and skills.

# Some history

I grew up in [Chongqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing), China, a city renowned for its breathtaking landscape and deliciously spicy food. Although 
I'm not particularly good at handling spicy food, I cherish the rich cultural heritage and the vibrant atmosphere of my 
hometown. In 2016, I moved to the United States to attend Rice University. My time at Rice was transformative, providing 
me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving.


After completing my studies at Rice University, I stayed in the Bay Area for a year during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This experience was both challenging and enriching, as it allowed me to immerse myself in one of the world's most dynamic 
tech hubs. I learned a great deal about resilience and adaptability during this time.


Currently, I reside in Philadelphia, which is the third city I've called home in the United States. I moved to Philly to 
complete my Master's program at the University of Pennsylvania, which has been a remarkable journey of academic and personal 
growth.
